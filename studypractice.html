            <!--Aria Roles-->
            <!--Aria roles are used to define certain sections of an HTML document further. They indicate to search engines the importance, type,
            and sort of content within the role itself. For example aria-toolbar defines the element as a collection of commonly used tools within the page. 
            certain roles also exist to seperate certain elements from one another. ARIA elements are implemented as such:-->

            <div id="examplediv" role="aria-navbar"></div><!--This element is a navbar-->

            <!--Microdata is data collected on an individual basis during a survey. In addition, it's a format used for adding more semantics to webpages and allowing
            for better search engine readablilty. Microdata defines various content and marks it within an HTML page, allowing search engines to read it and give the
            end user the desired content more quickly. hCard, vCard, and strata.org are all examples of microdata-->
