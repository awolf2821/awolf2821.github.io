	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Chicken Piccata is a classic Italian-American dish that marries simplicity with rich flavors, making it a beloved favorite in many households.<br>
	 Originating from Italy, "piccata" refers to meat, usually veal or chicken, that is sliced, dredged in flour, browned, and then served in a sauce.<br>
	 In the case of Chicken Piccata, tender chicken breasts are the star, enhanced by a tangy and savory lemon-butter sauce with capers. This particular<br>
	 Recipe hails from America's Test Kitchen, being relatively easy to prepare, and ensured to have good taste.</p>

	<h3>Prep Time: ~30mins</h3>
	<h4>Serves ~6-8</h4>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>4 6-8ox Chicken breasts</li>
		<li>Kosher Salt and Pepper</li>
		<li>2 Large Lemons</li>
		<li>3/4 Cup AP Flour</li>
		<li>1/4 Cup + 1 Tsp of Vegetable Oil</li>
		<li>1: Shallot (Minced), Garlic Clove<br>
		Cup Chicken Broth</li>
		<li>3 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided into 6 peices</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp Capers, Drained</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp Fresh Minced Parsley</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Directions</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half again horizontally, repeating 3 times. Place cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and gently<br>
	 pound to even ½-inch thickness. Toss with 2 teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes. </li>
	<li>Halve 1 lemon lengthwise. Trim ends from 1 half, halve lengthwise again, then cut crosswise ¼-inch-thick slices; set aside.<br>
	 Juice remaining parts and set aside 3 tablespoons juice. </li>
	<li>Spread flour in shallow dish. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking gently to remove excess. Place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet.</li>
	<li> Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until smoking. Place 6 cutlets in skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until golden brown on 1 side, 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
	 Flip and cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Return cutlets to wire rack. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 6 cutlets. </li>
	<li>Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil and shallot to skillet and cook until softened, 1 minute. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, ~30 seconds.</li>
	<li> Add broth, reserved lemon juice, and reserved lemon slices and bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits.</li>
	<li>Add cutlets to sauce and simmer for 4 minutes, flipping halfway through simmering. Transfer cutlets to platter.<br>
	Sauce should be thickened to consistency of heavy cream; if not, simmer 1 minute longer. Off heat, whisk in butter.<br>
	Stir in capers and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.</li>
