	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>This recipe was a staple for me during school from home and work-from-home. Delicious and easy to prepare, this dish provides a good pairing of cheesy flavor and basil taste.<br>
	It bases itself off of simple concepts, so it's another easy-to-prepare meal that delivers good tasting results. This is one of the beauties of cooking your own food, and why <br>
	i hold an opinion that everybody should know the basics of cooking, regardless of anything. Home cooking offers infinite customization and room to explore, if something isn't <br>
	quite to your taste, simply learn and know that you don't like that taste. The internet is also boundless, and you can find great recipes to use as bases for your cooking. </p>
	<h2>Optional Flair</h2>
	<p>Tomatoes lend themselves well to the flavor of this grilled cheese, fitting right in with the italian theme. Many herbs and such also fit in well with the theme, providing more<br>
	Herbal flavor in addition to the pesto already included. But again, these are my reccomendations, you can add anything you want to it and it will probably taste good.</p>

	<h3>Prep Time: ~15 min</h3>
	<h4>Serves One</h4>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>2 Pecies Sourdough Bread</li>
	    <li>Shredded Mozzerella Cheese</li>
	    <li>Pesto</li>
	    <li>Butter</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
	    <li>Cut the two peices of bread to the desired thickness. 3/4 inch thick is my reccomendation</li>
	    <li>Sprinkle the mozzerela cheese onto one side of one peice of bread, Forming a layer.</li>
	    <li>Cover the other peice of bread evenly with the pesto.</li>
	    <li>Place the two peices together, with the coated sides facing each other on the inside</li>
	    <li>Place a nonstick pan over a stove and heat the pan</li>
	    <li>Coat both outer-facing sides of the sandwich with butter</li>
	    <li>Place the sandwich on the hot pan, wait until the side is lightly brown to flip the sandwich. You can check<br>
	    this using a spatula and holding the sandwich up</li>
	    <li>Once the sandwich is done. Turn off the stove and transfer to a plate, serve warm for best resuls</li>
