		    <p class="text">As part of the curriculum at Arlington Tech, Every grade is required to participate in a project spanning the entire school year from November to April. The project
	varies in nature by grade, Moving from a grade-wide project in freshman year to an individualized project in senior year. Every core class (and some extras) has a singular focus for one month.
	This focus relates to the project in some way. for example: This year's project focuses on making the commute to ACC more enjoyable for students. English's focus was public art, Engineering's
	focus was on Transportation, ETC. The students then form teams and present a way to accomplish the proposed goal. The project that is judged "The Best" will be presented to the Arlington County
	Board.</p>

		<div id="Sony_PVM">
		    <h3 class="subheading">Sony PVM</h3>
		    <p class="text">I recently obtained a Sony PVM monitor from an auction of a nearby TV studio. PVM's are extremely desirable within the retro gaming community for their accuracy 
	and wide range of features. To my dismay, once i powered on the PVM, i discovered that it was not working properly. The green seemed to be diminished and the deflection could not stay stable.
	One of my main projects has been restoring this monitor so that i can either use it or resell it. I discovered what was going wrong within the CRT, and am planning to do a Re-Cap of the deflection 	    system and restore the green color. This project has been a learning experience for me and has taught me plenty of valuable skills regarding electronics repair.</p></div>
