# Factoring Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are a form of equation that when graphed, results in a perabola. Once they\
are learned, they are relatively easy to handle and simplify. They can be factored into many different forms\
each differing slightly from one another. 
## Standard Form
The most common form for quadratic equations is written like this:
### $y=ax^2+bx+c$
a, b, and c are all coefficients, they can be anything, while x remains x in the equation.\
Let's make this our example.
$6x^2+11x-35$
## Factoring By Grouping
a, b, and c have a special relationship. two factors of A * C add to equal B, and we can split
Bx into these two factors (let's just call them J for now). so the updated equation would be:\
$ax^2+J_{1}x+J_{2}x+c$. this is the first step of factoring by grouping. within our example,\
6 and -35  multiply to make $-210x^2$, which can be broken down into -10x and 21x. making\
the equation $6x^2-10x+21x-35$.
### 
The next step involves extracting the common factor from both\
areas of the equation. so if the first two numbers in the equation were $2x^2+2x$, then you could\
extract the common factor of 2x in order to make the equation $2x(x+1)$. The same principle applies\
to the last two numbers of the equation as well, and the numbers inside the grouping symbols should be\
the same as the first. With this principle applied, our example becomes $2x(3x-5)7(3x-5)$
### 
The last step involves combining the two factors, which is extremely simple. simply write the factors together\
in a grouping symblol, and add the grouping symbol from the last step, which should leave you with an equation that\
looks like this: $(2x-2)(3x+4). This is known as factored form. The factored form for our example is $(2x+7)(3x-5).
## Factored Form
Factored form is another form for quadratic equations that is easy to read. factored form contains the two x-coordinates\
of the x intercepts of the perabola as plain numbers (though they are opposites. factored form looks like this:
### $(Ax-b)(Cx-d)$
B and D are the X-Intercepts. factored form can easily be returned to standard form by multiplying in a certain patterm.\
Following First (First number in each grouping is multiplied), Outside (Outside numbers are multiplied), inside (Inside numbers\
are multiplied, and Last (Last numbers are multiplied. You can remember this order using an acronym FOIL.
## Summary
Quadratic equations have many different forms. The most common is standard form, but standard form can easily be factored\
into different forms that are much more readable, such as Factored Form. This process is relatively simple and involves\
basic addition, division, and multiplication.
