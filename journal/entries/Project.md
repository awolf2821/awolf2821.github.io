# Wordpress Project
This is my wordpress project. The prompt was "Create a website for a theoretical buisness using wordpress."\
I created a website for my own buisness, Retro Renew. The buisness restores old videogame consoles primarily,\
along with other old tech, giving it new life. The business offers restoration services along with prerestored\
console kits. Making the site itself was easy, as it required no code at all and elements could be simply added into\
the page. Finding images was harder, along with formatting them correctly for the site. Wordpress's free version is also\
very restrictive in features and customization, but I think I was able to create a good project. you can check it out here:
