# Markdown Journal
## Jackson Shartzer
###  Introduction
This is my Markdown Journal.\
It's like a normal Journal, but written using Markdown,\
a powerful formatting language designed for writing text-based websites.
So far, we've learned the Terminal, Vim, Git, and Markdown, so i'm\
going to elaborate on what we've learned
### Terminal
The unix terminal is at the heart of what we do in class, it's where we access vim, push to our GitHub,\
and write our documents in markdown. The terminal program in macOS is based on the commands for unix, or\
unified linux. I often use the terminal in fullscreen to see longer lines of text and to recreate\
the experience that anybody doing this in the early days of computers would have.
### vim
vim is a text editor that runs in the command line. it was one of the very first text editors to exist and\
works well, but can be a bit clunky to use, as it doesn't have a GUI\
and it can be hard to remember the commands\
needed to operate vim, but with practice it's very robust and usable.
### git
git is a system developed by Linus Torvalds, the man who created Linux, made with a firm belief in open-source\
software, git is used to communicate with a central repository, where multiple developers can upload projects and code\
into the software. Github is a free service which hosts a repository, and many large developers around the world use it.\
Chromium (which is the search engine behind the google chrome browser), is downloadable on github
### Markdown
markdown is a writing language optimized for use in websites, it's what this document is written in.\
different modifiers can be used to change the text, for example:
- this
- is
- a
- list.

MARKDOWN is a vital tool for creating text based websites easily and effectively.
